        <div class="footer-content-part">Disclaimer: Apache StreamPipes (incubating) is an effort undergoing incubation
            at The Apache Software Foundation (ASF), sponsored by the Apache Incubator. Incubation is required of all
            newly accepted projects until a further review indicates that the infrastructure, communications, and
            decision making process have stabilized in a manner consistent with other successful ASF projects. While
            incubation status is not necessarily a reflection of the completeness or stability of the code, it does
            indicate that the project has yet to be fully endorsed by the ASF.
