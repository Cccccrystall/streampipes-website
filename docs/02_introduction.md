## What is StreamPipes?

Apache StreamPipes is a self-service Industrial IoT toolbox to enable non-technical users to connect, analyze and explore IoT data streams. The main goal of StreamPipes is to help users bridging the gap between operational technology (OT) and information technology (IT). This is achieved by providing a set of tools which help to make industrial data accessible for downstream tasks such as data analytics and condition monitoring.
When working with industrial data and especially when building upon an open source stack for such tasks, users are often faced with the management and integration of a variety of different tools for data connectivity, messaging & integration, data enrichment, data storage, visualization and analytics. This results in an increasing operational complexity and hardly manageable software stacks.

Apache StreamPipes addresses this problem: It provides a complete toolbox with a variety of different tools to easily gather data from OT systems such as Programmatic Logic Controllers (PLCs), industrial protocols (
